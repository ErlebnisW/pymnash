This module is intended to allow finding nash equilibria of multi-player games.
It is still in early development and since I'm just doing this in my spare time it may never get anywhere.
So far all it can do is check if a purported nash equibrium is in fact an ne.

The number of possibilities to check completely explodes as we increase the number of players and actions, so we will never be able to
find all the equilibria except for relatively small games.
